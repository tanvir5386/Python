Gentle waves upon the shore,
Dancing in the moonlight's glow.
Nature's rhythm, evermore,
As time's eternal waters flow.

Whispers in the autumn breeze,
Rustling through the golden leaves.
Stories carried on the seas,
To distant shores and memories.

In this moment, pure and bright,
Poetry takes wing in flight.
Through words we paint our dreams so clear,
And make the distant feel so near.
